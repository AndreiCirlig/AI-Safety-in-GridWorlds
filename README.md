# AI-Safety-in-GridWorlds

As part of my Artificial Intelligence coursework, I worked on a project based on Google DeepMindâ€™s AI Safety GridWorlds paper. This project focused on reinforcement learning environments that exhibit fundamental challenges in AI safety, such as safe interruptibility, avoiding side effects, and reward gaming.

What I Built:
Designed and programmed multiple GridWorld environments that model real-world AI safety concerns.
Implemented decision-making agents with different behaviors, including:
Predefined path-following agents (Safe Interruptibility)
Agents avoiding irreversible actions (Avoiding Side Effects)
Reward-exploiting & optimal agents (Reward Gaming)
Simulated and analyzed agent performance across different AI challenges.
